  - `user_id` → users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  - `store_id` → store(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- **Fields:** created_at
- **Constraints:** UNIQUE(user_id, store_id)
- **Purpose:** Junction table linking users to favourite stores (Many-to-Many)
- **Special:** CASCADE DELETE on both foreign keys, preventing duplicate favourites

### Relationship Summary

**One-to-Many Relationships:**
- users → store (one owner, one store)
- users → cart (one user, multiple carts)
- store → products (one store, many products)
- categories → products (one category, many products)
- role → users (one role, many users)

**Many-to-Many Relationships:**
- users ↔ stores (via favourites) - Users can favourite multiple stores
- cart ↔ products (via cart_products) - Cart can contain multiple products
- role ↔ permission (via role_permission) - Roles can have multiple permissions

**Special Constraints:**
- **CASCADE DELETE:** Deleting user/store removes all favourites automatically
- **UNIQUE:** Users cannot favourite the same store twice

### Database Setup

**Local Development:**
```sql
-- 1. Create database
CREATE DATABASE bretix;

-- 2. Create tables in order (respecting dependencies)
-- See schema file for complete SQL
```

**Production:**
- **Hosting:** Neon PostgreSQL with serverless scaling
- **Features:** Automatic backups, connection pooling, SSL encryption
- **Connection:** Uses environment variable `DB_URL`

Run the database schema file to create all necessary tables and relationships with proper foreign key constraints.

## 💭 The Story Behind Bretix

**Bretix** is more than just a bootcamp project - it represents a vision that started 6 years ago. The name comes from "**Pretty Expressions**", reflecting the idea of creating beautiful, meaningful interactions in the digital shopping space. While the original vision was delayed by circumstances, this bootcamp provided the perfect opportunity to bring it to life.

Our goal isn't just to build another e-commerce platform - we aim to solve real problems: making online shopping trustworthy for our communities, helping local stores thrive digitally, and creating a seamless bridge between traditional shopping and modern convenience.
